# ALX Airbnb Database Module ‚Äì Advanced SQL & Optimization

## üìå About the Project
This project is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focusing on advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques using a simulated Airbnb database.  
It covers real-world database challenges such as **query performance optimization**, **complex SQL scripting**, **indexing**, and **table partitioning**.  
By completing this project, developers gain hands-on experience with **database management** and **performance tuning**‚Äîessential skills for working with large-scale, high-traffic applications.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- **Master Advanced SQL**: Write complex queries using joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions.  
- **Optimize Query Performance**: Use `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` to identify bottlenecks and refactor SQL for speed.  
- **Implement Indexing & Partitioning**: Improve performance for large datasets by applying indexing and table partitioning strategies.  
- **Monitor & Refine Performance**: Track database health and adjust schema/queries for efficiency.  
- **Think Like a DBA**: Make informed, data-driven decisions about schema design and optimization for high-volume applications.

## üìã Requirements
Before starting, ensure you have:

- A solid understanding of SQL fundamentals (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`).  
- Knowledge of relational database concepts (primary keys, foreign keys, normalization).  
- Basic experience with performance monitoring tools (`EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`).  
- Ability to set up and manage a **GitHub repository** for submitting work.

## üîë Key Highlights
1. **Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams**  
   Model relationships between users, bookings, properties, and reviews in the Airbnb schema.

2. **Complex Queries with Joins**  
   Use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` to combine data across multiple tables.

3. **Power of Subqueries**  
   Work with correlated and non-correlated subqueries for advanced filtering and analytics.

4. **Aggregations & Window Functions**  
   Use aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`) and window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`) for data analysis.

5. **Indexing for Optimization**  
   Identify performance bottlenecks and create indexes to speed up query execution.

6. **Query Optimization Techniques**  
   Refactor queries to remove redundancies and improve efficiency.

7. **Partitioning Large Tables**  
   Implement table partitioning (e.g., on bookings by date range) to boost query performance.

8. **Performance Monitoring & Schema Refinement**  
   Continuously monitor with `SHOW PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to maintain optimal performance.
