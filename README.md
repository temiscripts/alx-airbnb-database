# ALX Airbnb Database Project

This project is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**.  
It involves designing, implementing, and optimizing a relational database for an Airbnb-like application.  
The tasks focus on advanced SQL techniques, query optimization, indexing, partitioning, and performance monitoring.

## üìå Project Overview
The project simulates a real-world database system for a property rental platform.  
It emphasizes efficiency, scalability, and clean design principles.

Key objectives include:
- Designing an efficient and normalized database schema.
- Implementing advanced SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
- Applying optimization techniques for large datasets.
- Monitoring and refining database performance.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By completing this project, the following skills are developed:

1. **Advanced SQL Querying**  
   - Complex joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`).
   - Subqueries (correlated and non-correlated).
   - Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`) and window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`).

2. **Database Optimization**  
   - Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks using `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.
   - Creating indexes for high-traffic queries.
   - Implementing table partitioning to handle large datasets efficiently.

3. **Database Design Best Practices**  
   - Designing ER diagrams to define relationships between entities.
   - Applying normalization to reduce redundancy.
   - Defining constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys for data integrity.

4. **Performance Monitoring**  
   - Using profiling tools to track query execution times.
   - Refining schema design and queries based on performance data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Before starting the project, the following are required:
- Understanding of SQL basics (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`).
- Knowledge of relational database concepts (primary keys, foreign keys, normalization).
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub for version control.

## üìÇ Project Workflow

### 1. Database Design
- Create an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** showing all entities and relationships.
- Define attributes, relationships, and cardinality.

### 2. Schema Definition
- Use SQL DDL to create tables and constraints.
- Define indexes on frequently queried columns.

### 3. Data Seeding
- Populate tables with realistic sample data.
- Include edge cases for robust query testing.

### 4. Query Development
- Write SQL scripts for complex joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- Use window functions for ranking and analytical queries.

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Analyze queries with `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`.
- Create indexes where needed.
- Partition large tables (e.g., bookings by date).

### 6. Monitoring and Refinement
- Evaluate query performance.
- Adjust schema and indexing strategies as needed.
